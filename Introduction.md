Naming is an essential aspect of *every* programming language. It doesn’t matter where you are in the stack or what kind of programming you do. If you name things well, you write better code. It’s a skill set that will never become outdated over time (and if it does, it would mean the robots have officially taken everything over anyways).



`This is some code`

```C#
public string CreationDate
{
	get
	{
		return DateTime.UtcNow;
	}
}
```
