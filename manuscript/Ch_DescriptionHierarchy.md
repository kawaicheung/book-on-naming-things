## Description hierarchy

I would venture to guess that native English speakers (like myself), and in particular, programmers raised in the United States (like myself), have a harder time with naming things well than most. That’s because we tend to measure and categorize things in ridiculously odd ways. It’s just not odd to us because we’re so accustomed to it.

Consider the way we measure things in the United States. We measure length in inches. There are 12 inches to a foot, 3 feet to a yards, and a sensible 1,760 yards to a mile. And most of us couldn’t tell you the latter without looking it up.  We measure quantities in ounces, then pounds (16 ounces to a pound).  

When you look at our measuring units, it seems rather arbitrary that we even use the decimal system---you know, the one that naturally fits into measures of centimeters, meters, kilometers, milliliters and liters. 

Milli. Centi. Kilo.  All wonderfully inferrable prefixes from ancient roots. But, just forget inferring any meaning of one American unit of measure from another. A furlong? Of course -- ⅛ of a mile!

Now consider dates. In most other places, dates are written in the form year-month-day or day-month-year. In other words, the units of measure either get narrower or broaden as the date is read across.
Americans write dates as month-day-year. In other words, the largest unit of measure is last, the second largest is first, and the smallest is in th middle. Why? Why not.

Finally, consider how we name people. In Chinese, the family name is spoken first, followed by the “first” and “middle” name. Often times, the “first” name is shared by siblings of the same gender and the “middle” name uniquely identifies the individual. For instance, while I write my name as Ka Wai Cheung in English, I would write or speak it as Cheung Ka Wai in Chinese. As such, names in Chinese culture are written from a broad to narrow scope. I identify myself as part of the Cheung family first, then one of the male siblings, and then specifically, me.


[This too...how we describe things…-> Arabic/western - big red truck]

I don’t want to start a philosophical argument on whether one way of measuring or writing things is better than the other, but living in America means you’re exposed to a somewhat arbitrary way of naming different things. So, naturally, the exercise of naming a variable or method in code in a way that makes searching and categorizing said names, might feel a bit counterintuitive at first.


Yellow-Callout
Blue-Callout

Callout-Yellow
Callout-Blue

What do you care about? English says “yellow callout” but really you care about the callout first, and then the style underneath second.
