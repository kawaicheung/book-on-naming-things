# Preface

At some point in my software career, things got really complicated.

When I first started writing full-stack applications, I did so with delightfully simple architectures. In the beginning, I wrote web pages that called their own methods which hit a single database directly. Later on, I graduated to MVC frameworks to better separate presentation from data and logic. Then came injecting dependencies and inversion of control to make my applications more readily testable. After that, I was introduced to the idea of decoupling a monolithic application into a system of small services. Meanwhile, a similar pattern of increasing complexity began to develop on the front-end. 

Today, a single web application can feel like a monstrosity of misdirections, re-routing, and configuration to do, roughly, what I was able to do twenty years ago -- show something of value to the user.

Many more people are entering the software development industry today. That's a _wonderful_ thing. But, I can only shutter at the weight of knowledge a new developer is asked to understand from day one. Digesting all the details about how today's complex applications work isn't a healthy way to learn to code.

Instead, I believe there are fundamentals of programming, agnostic to whatever today's programmatic flavors-of-the-day are, that are far more important to practice in the beginning. More importantly, they are important to _continue_ to practice as we're introduced to more and more ideas.

One of these skills is naming things well. And that is the primary focus of this book.
