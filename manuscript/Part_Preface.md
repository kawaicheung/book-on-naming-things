# Preface

At some point in my software writing career, things got really complicated.

When I first started writing "full-stack" applications, I did so with delightfully simple architectures. At first, I wrote web pages that called their own methods which hit a database directly. Later on, I worked with MVC frameworks to better separate presentation from data and logic. After that, I was introduced to the idea of decoupling services from the application entirely. Then came injecting dependencies and inversion of control to make my applications more viable for automated testing.

Meanwhile, a similar pattern of complexity began to develop on the front-end. Today, a single web application can feel like a monstrosity of misdirections, re-routing, and configuration to do, roughly, what I was able to do twenty years ago -- show something of value to the user.

Many more people are entering the software development industry today. That's a _wonderful_ thing. But, I can only shutter at the weight of knowledge a new developer is asked to carry from day one. I don't think learning everything about how today's complex applications are built is healthy. Instead, there are fundamentals -- ways of thinking -- about programming, agnostic to today's programmatic flavors-of-the-day, that are far more important to get right first.

One of these skills is naming things well. That is the sole focus of this book.

Naming is a skill every developer needs. The day we don't care about naming is the day the robots have entirely taken over and there's no more software for humans to write. Whether you're just learning to code or have been at it since the Apple logo was multi-colored, I think you'll gain something from this book.
