# Preface

At some point in my software writing career, things got really complicated.

When I first started writing full-stack applications, I did so with delightfully simple architectures. At first, I wrote web pages that called their own methods which would hit a database directly. Later on, I graduated to MVC frameworks to better separate presentation from data and logic. After that, I was introduced to the idea of decoupling services from the application entirely. Then came injecting dependencies and inversion of control to make my applications more readily testable. 

Meanwhile, a similar pattern of complexity began to develop on the front-end. Today, a single web application can feel like a monstrosity of misdirections, re-routing, and configuration to do, roughly, what I was able to do twenty years ago -- show something of value to the user.

Many more people are entering the software development industry today. That's a _wonderful_ thing. But, I can only shutter at the weight of knowledge a new developer is asked to carry from day one. I don't think digesting everything about how today's complex applications work is a healthy way to learn to code.

Instead, there are fundamental programming skills, agnostic to today's programmatic flavors-of-the-day, that are far more important to get right first. More importantly, they are important to _continue_ to get right as we're introduced to more and more new ideas.

One of these skills is naming things well. And that's the primary focus of this book.
