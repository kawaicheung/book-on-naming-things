# Programing as an art

The programming industry is full of heated arguments. We are passionate about our work and, more specifically, about _how_ our work should be done. In other crafts, the end result seems to matter more than the process. No one criticizes a band for the process by which a song is written. Yet, in programming, the process is intricately scrutinized.

In my experience, there isn't a rigid process for writing software. Every individual and team I've worked on starts with a template on how best to approach coding. But, in the throes of development, processes are often scrapped, modified, or otherwise mutated. There's a constant tension between what feels natural _right now_ with what the process tells us. This goes for both processes of management (like sprints, scope, deadlines) and processes of coding (like TDD, DDD, BDD).

In my opinion, the best kind of software process is fluid -- it ebbs and flows according to what feels the most natural. It flows much like writing a book might. There are moments of inspiration and moments of exasperation.

I tend to write my code with very small teams -- sometimes even solo. In these situations, I tend to be "all over the place" with my code. Sometimes I'm working on a larger refactoring, other times on continuing with a new feature. Progress isn't strictly linear. 

Unfortunately, this kind of uncertainty isn't particularly viable in a business setting. Software is business. And business needs to know what will happen and when. 

But, there's a place for software development that feels more like writing, music, acting -- the _arts_, if you will. The end release might be this year or next year depending on how things are going, much like music albums arrive when the music feels done.

All of this might sound blasphemous to the software Gods that believe in a certain kind of rigidity of process that lends itself to "good habits".  But, it is a _way_ to build software. And, if you have the luxury of time and energy to do things in this way, and your natural tendencies pull you in this direction, I say don't fight it. Build with lucidity. Focus on the words. Create software like you create art.

And don't forget to test.
