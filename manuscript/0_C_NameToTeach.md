## INCOMPLETE: Name to Teach

I have a very simple thing to say about how we teach programming. The more advanced you are, the more likely you'll teach the craft poorly.

As you get more advanced, you understand so many things that it becomes harder to see that some of the things you understand _aren't readily understood_ by others. 

For example, having worked with object-oriented programming languages for over twenty years, to me, the concept of a class constructor is obvious. There needs to be a defined method to instantiate an instance of the object a class defines. 

But, when I first was taught about class construction, I was at a complete and utter loss. It was unclear to me because I couldn't grasp the idea that a class definition and an instance of that class were two different things entirely. Something so utterly fundamental to me now (so much so that I don't even consciously think about it anymore) left me sure that programming was not for me. It was like someone explaining sound to a person that was born deaf. "Some sounds are louder than others" is meaningless to someone who can't hear.

A significant part of this problem was how 

At this level, we often teach concepts too abstractly -- as if diving directly into concrete examples that demonstrate a concept would somehow mask the underlying purpose of the concept.
