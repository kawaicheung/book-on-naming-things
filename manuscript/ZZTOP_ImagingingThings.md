# Naming Things

So I finally got around to working on this data migration feature--something I had been putting off for months. But, eventually, the migration feature crept to the top of my to-do list. That, and some consistent nudging from my business partner, Mike. OK--it was mainly the consistent nudging. Sometimes you build things so your business partner will stop bugging you.

For the past twelve months, I had been developing a new version of DoneDone, an issue tracking and customer support tool that I originally created almost ten years ago. It's kind of a rarity in this industry, but I've been fortunate enough to work on this one product for a very long time. Though the codebase has had a handful of contributors in its life, I've been there since day one. I know how this code works better than I know how my closest friends think.

The new version wasn't a rewrite; I branched off the existing version as the starting point for what would be a year's worth of refactorings, removals, and new feature additions. By the end of it, it was essentially a complete rewrite.
