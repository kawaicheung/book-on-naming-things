# What makes a name good, then?

I've shown a handful of examples describing various approaches to naming things well. If you haven't noticed, some of my thoughts contradict each other. I go for the long and descriptive name to clarify a method that's arguably doing too much. I might choose to shorten a variable name if I think it's damaging the overall shape of the code around it. Sometimes, consistency amongst a set of method names is good; Other times, I prefer to name a method uniquely.

Picking the "right" name is almost always going to be a trade-off. Another name might be simpler or more descriptive or more tidy or easier to scan. A name is a good one if it's making the right trade-off. And, that, of course is entirely subjective. It depends on what you feel is the most important aspect of that particular construct to detail in the name.

This is what makes naming, and more generally coding, an art. ....
