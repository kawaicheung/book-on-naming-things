# What is the role of aesthetics and style?
 
Writing clean code is good. No one will  disagree with this. But, what about writing delightful code? Code that has a certain aesthetic, that's pleasing to the eye and pleasurable to read. Is this a goal worth aiming for?

The answer usually hinges on the experience of the programmer you're asking. 

Ask someone who maintains a large enterprise system for a multi-million dollar organization. Their energy is mainly spent negotiating between various dysfunctional technical teams.  The codebases they work with, touched by hundreds of developers over time, can't possibly be an aeshetic masterpiece. They're likely to tell you that the goal of a codebase is to provide a function for a business. Any aspirations of aesthetics and style -- especially for the goal of delight -- are silly ones.

Ask someone working on their own pet project, the one they've been noodling with and rewriting for months, and they might tell you the aesthetics of the code mean a lot -- perhaps too much. That's why they keep rewriting it.

To code where aesthetics matter more than speed is a guilty pleasure. You're not paid to write beautiful code -- you're paid to produce features and release them so other people might buy your work and pay the business so the business is sustained. 

When I daydream about writing code that's delightful, it usually occurs in a place of solitude. I'm writing my own code, for myself, to humor myself, and no one else. I go at a pace that doesn't impact the beauty of my work. It's hobby-coding. It's delightful because I get pleasure from reading it. 

Will the code build an app that will be profitable? It doesn't matter -- that's not the reason I decided to write the code in the first place.

So, is there an argument for delightful code in the workplace? I would say yes.

Delightful code is code I want to work on. I appreciate the aesthetics and want to maintain those aesthetics. If you live in a well-kept neighborhood where your neighbors keep their lawns tidy, you will also likely do the same. It's not just because you don't want to be "that neighbor" but you gain a sense of pride in living in that neighborhood. Live in a neighborhood where that's let itself go and the pride you might have in maintaining a nice lawn will succumb to the weight of apathy from everyone else around you.

In the same way, delightful code is code you want to keep being delightful. It makes you *care* about the code more. And regardless of the business, having programmers working on a system they care about is always going to be more beneficial to the health of the software than having programmers that have let their lawns go.
