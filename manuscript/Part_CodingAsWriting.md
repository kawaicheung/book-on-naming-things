# Coding as writing

In code, objects and methods create actions. Actions, when stitched together in a certain way, shape larger components. Components then become the building blocks for the entire application. 

Coding sounds an awful lot like writing, doesn't it? Nouns and verbs create sentences, sentences shape paragraphs, paragraphs build chapters, and so forth.

This section approaches better naming by thinking about it in the way we'd think about writing good prose. Is the name of an object clear and unambiguous? While the individual words feel right, does the entire line read coherently?
