## INCOMPLETE: Code penmanship

In programming, the little details make all the difference between code that looks carelessly written and error-prone versus code that looks confident and well-intentioned.

Naming things well, of course, plays a significant role in this. Good naming does for code what good style and grammar does for prose. But, once we get the names right, the work is not done. A well-crafted piece of code also has a tidyness to it. For lack of a better word, it has good _penmanship_. 

It's strange to think about code this way. After all, we're not writing code -- literally -- with our hands. But, there is such thing as good penmanship in code. Just as sloppy handwriting can sully well-written words, untidy code can tarnish otherwise beautiful code.
