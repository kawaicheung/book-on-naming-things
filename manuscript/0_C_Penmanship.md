## Code penmanship

Every great craftsperson spends years honing their skills. Eventually, they reach a point where the things that are difficult to most become second-nature to them. This is how we reach expertise. But, there's another side to being great at a craft -- discipline. The best artists produce beautiful work consistently because take care of all the tedious little details.

In programming, these little details make all the difference between code that looks carelessly written and error-prone versus one that looks confident and well-intentioned.

Naming things, of course, plays a significant role in this. Good naming does for code what good style and grammar does for prose. But, once we get the names right, the work is not done. A well-crafted piece of code also has a tidyness to it. For lack of a better word, it has good _penmanship_. 

It's strange to think about code this way. After all, we're not writing code -- literally -- with our hands. But, there is such thing as good penmanship in code. Just as sloppy handwriting can sully well-written words, untidy code can tarnish otherwise beautiful code.

Consider this method:

### Grouping

### Ordering
