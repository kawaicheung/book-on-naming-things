# Code Grammar

In code, we define objects and methods to create actions. These actions, when stitched together in a certain way, create larger components. Components then become the building blocks for an entire application. 

Coding sounds an awful lot like writing, doesn't it? Nouns and verbs shape sentences, sentences create paragraphs, paragraphs build chapters, and so forth.

A good way to approach writing code is to think about the same principles that make for good prose. Is the name of an object clear and unambiguous? Does an entire line read coherently?

In this section, we'll dissect code like a traditional language -- as verbs, nouns, and sentences -- to see what makes a particular name better or worse.
