# Code Grammar

In code, we use objects and methods to construct actions. These actions, stitched together in a particular way, create sections of functionality that building up to form the application.  It sounds an awful lot like writing prose, where nouns and verbs shape sentences, sentences create paragraphs, paragraphs build into chapters and books.

When it comes to naming things well in code, I find it easier to come in with the mindset that your code is prose. We should be as finicky about using the right words as we would be with all the other good habits of programming.
