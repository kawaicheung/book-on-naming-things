# Why naming matters

Our industry is littered with techniques on building sustainable software. But, these techniques usually come with a big caveat: They're typically large in scope. You can't just toss in a framework, pattern, or architecture onto your existing codebase like paint on a canvas -- it's intensive work. You might spend weeks on a refactoring and only then realize the result wasn't worth the effort.

This is why I'm a big fan of focusing on naming things. Naming is fast. Something can be named and renamed over and over again. You can continually improve a name without being "stuck" with a decision. The returns are equally enticing.

Renaming an object or method can clarify something that was previously ambiguous about it. It might expose an obvious painpoint you didn't see before. It also makes it easier for someone else to figure out what your intentions were when you wrote the code. That "someone else" might even be you a few months from now.

Naming is the first thing I look at when I want to improve _any_ codebase.
