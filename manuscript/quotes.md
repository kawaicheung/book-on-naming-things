"Caring about what we name things in programming is one of the absolute central skills of the discipline. I regularly spend HOURS searching for just the right domain language. When I find it, itâ€™s one of the deepest satisfactions of the work." - DHH (https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1032267640033538048)


"Of all the technical debt you can incur, the worst in my experience is bad names -- for database columns, variables, functions, etc. Fix those IMMEDIATELY before they metastasize all over your codebase and become extremely painful to fix later.. and they always do." - Jeff Atwood https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/1115890829405638657

"One of the biggest sins you can commit is to stop programming when it works." - Brandon Rhodes - PyCon 2013

"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things" - Phil Karlton

"Squint you eyes. Lean back. Look for changes in shape. Look for changes in colour. Shape reflects cycolmetric complexity - lots of nested conditionals. Colour reflects differing levels of abstraction, different types of things are in a mish mash. The squint test can help!" -Sandi Metz
