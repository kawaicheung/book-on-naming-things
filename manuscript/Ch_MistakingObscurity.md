# Masking Obscurity for Elegance

Trying to get too cute rather than just saying "ContractOrTemplate" for now...

The fact is, a code name is more valuable for what it does now than what it 'might be' later --- so go for concreteness (even too constraiing) and loosen the name as you go... dont write names as they might morph into them. Change the names when you're in the act of morphing their repsonsibilities.
