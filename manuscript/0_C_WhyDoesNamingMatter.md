## Why Naming Matters

We all have opinions on how to write better code. Usually, these opinions revolve around meaty concepts like frameworks, patterns, and architectures.  But, these concepts usually come with a price: They're large in scope. 

You can't magically toss a framework into an existing codebase -- it's _intensive_ work. It's also hard to unwind once you start. You might spend days implementing something only to realize the result wasn't nearly worth the effort.

On the other hand, naming is fast. It gives you immediate feedback. It doesn't require additional infrastructure. If a name doesn't feel right, you can change it. You can continually improve a name without being "stuck" with your original decision. 

The returns are equally enticing.

Renaming something can clarify what was previously ambiguous about it. A descriptive name might expose a problem you didn't see before. A well-considered name makes it easier for someone else to figure out what your intentions were when you originally wrote the code. That someone else might even be you a few months from now. 

Naming is the first thing I consider when I want to quickly improve a codebase. This is a book about how I approach naming (and renaming) things in code.
