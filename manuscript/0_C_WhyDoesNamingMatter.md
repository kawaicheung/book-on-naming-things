## Why Does Naming Matter?

We all have opinions on how to write good code. Usually, these opinions revolve around abstract concepts like frameworks, patterns, and architectures.  But, these concepts usually come with a price: They're large in scope. You can't just toss in a framework into an existing codebase. It's _intensive_ work. 

It's also hard to unwind once you start. You might spend days implementing something only to realize the result wasn't nearly worth the effort.

This is why naming matters. Naming is fast. Naming doesn't require additional infrastructure. If a name doesn't feel right, you can change it. You can continually improve a name without being "stuck" with your original decision. The returns are equally enticing.

Renaming an object or method can clarify something that was previously ambiguous about it. A name might expose a problem you didn't see before. A good name makes it easier for someone else to figure out what your intentions were when you originally wrote the code. That "someone else" might even be you a few months from now.

Naming is the first thing I look at when I want to improve a codebase.
