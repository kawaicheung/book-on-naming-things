Writing clean code is good. No one will disagree with this. But, what about writing delightful code? Code that has a certain aesthetic, that's pleasing to the eye and pleasurable to read. Is this a goal worth aiming for?

The answer usually hinges on the experience of the programmer you're asking. 

Ask someone who maintains a large enterprise system and whose energy is mainly spent negotiating between various dysfunctional technical teams. They're likely to tell you that the goal of a codebase is to provide a function for a business. Any aspirations of aesthetics and style -- especially for the goal of delight -- are silly ones.

Ask someone working on their own pet project, the one they've been noodling with and rewriting for months, and they might tell you the aesthetics of the code mean a lot -- perhaps too much.

To code where aesthetics matter more than speed is a guilty pleasure. You're not paid to write beautiful code -- you're paid to produce features and release them so other people might buy your work and pay the business so the business is sustained.

When I daydream about writing code that's delightful, it usually occurs in a place of solitude. I'm writing my own code, for myself, to humor myself and no one else. I go at a pace that doesn't impact the beauty of my work. It's hobby-coding. It's delightful because I get pleasure from reading it. 

Will the code build an app that will be profitable? It doesn't matter -- that's not the reason I decided to write the code in the first place.
