# Introduction


**Why naming matters**

We all have opinions on how to write better code. The debates go on interminably. 

Usually, these opinions revolve around meaty concepts like frameworks, patterns, and architectures. But, these concepts usually come with a price: They're large in scope. 

You can't just pour a new framework into an existing codebase like wet cement--it's _detailed_ work. It's also hard to unwind that work once you've started. You might spend days implementing something only to realize the result wasn't nearly worth the effort.

On the other hand, changing the name of something is fast. It gives you immediate feedback. It doesn't require additional infrastructure. If a name doesn't feel right, you can change it again. You can continually improve a name without being stuck with your original decision. 

The returns are equally enticing.

Renaming something well can clarify what was previously ambiguous about it. A descriptive name might expose a problem you didn't see before. The right name makes it easier for someone else to figure out what your intentions were when you originally wrote the code. That someone else might even be you a few months from now. 

Unlike a book or movie script, there is no final draft of a codebase. A codebase is an ever-evolving manuscript that requires as much attention over the words we use as the functions we create. Writing code is one of the most complex forms of communication today. And given the pace of change with programming languages, paying attention to naming is more critical than ever.

So, that's why I put this book together. A programming book dedicated solely to the art of naming things.

***A quick note:** All of the examples I'll discuss are written in Microsoft's C# language and use object-oriented principles. But, those are just tangential details and shouldn't get in the way even if you've never programmed in C# before. Regardless of what language or style of programming you use, it's the thought-process that I hope you take away from each example.*

*Many of my examples also come from my work developing DoneDone, an issue tracker and customer support tool. In a book like this, It's critical to see real examples of imperfect code rather than fabricated ones.*
