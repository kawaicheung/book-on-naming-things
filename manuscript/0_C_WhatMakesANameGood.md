# What makes a name good?

Coding is the strangest kind of art. For starters, our audience is ourselves, our fellow programmers, and nobody else. No one--in their right mind--is a casual reader of code. 

There is also no sense of finality. Code writing is never "done". It is constantly iterated upon even after (and especially when) the software finally launches. And so, the person who is reading code isn't doing so relaxed on their favorite chair, curled up to their laptop under the warm light of a reading lamp. Instead, they are probably reading code sitting at their desk, mildly stressed with furrowed brow, in the process of figuring out what the code is trying to say because they need to understand it in order to fix something about it or add something to it.

This makes the qualifications for a good name different than any other kind of name in any other kind of writing. 

* A good name might be long. 
* It might be short. 
* It might stand out. 
* It might fade into the background. 
* It might be full of detail. 
* It might be abstract. 

Now, what does a good name *feel* like? I can answer that more assuredly.

A good name makes code clearer. If a method's name requires you to dig into the details everytime you stumble across it, it's likely you can come up with a better name.

A good names make reading code more fluid. You can scan code more easily because the words flow better together. Your eyes dance over the code because its shape feels natural. You grasp what the code is saying because there's an orderliness to the way constructs are named.

Finally, a good name--if it can do so without sacrificing more important matters--ought to delight your reader. Yes, delight your reader. If you can make a future reader of your code go, "Oh- I like the way you named that!", you should. In the same way that a great cook can make food taste delectable, not just nourish, or a great architect can design a building that inspires, not just protects, a great code writer can write code that delights, not just functions. The mildly stressed developer will thank you for it.

Remember these values: *Clarity*, *fluidity*, and *delight*. They're the qualitative tests we'll use to decide if we've improved upon a name.
