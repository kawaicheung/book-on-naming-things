## What Makes a Name Good

What does a good name look like? As with most qualitative things in programming, it depends.

A good name might be long. It might be short. It might stand out. It might fade into the background. It might be full of detail. It might be abstract. Like writing prose, the quality of any particular word depends on the context of all the other words around it. 

Now, what does a good name feel like? I can answer that more assuredly.

First, a good name makes code clearer. If a method's name constantly requires us to dig into the details everytime we stumble across it, there's a good chance we can come up with a better name.

Second, a good name makes reading code more fluid. We can scan code more easily because the words flow better. Our eyes dance over the code because its shape feels natural. We can grasp what the code is saying because there's an orderliness to how (and what) constructs are named.

Finally, the right names can make the exact same code more elegant and beautiful. This isn't just to tickle the fancy of the reader. Code that's elegant is more enjoyable to work with. It's also likely to _stay_ elegant. The next coder will care more about a well-written codebase because they'll appreciate the work that's already there (or, at least, don't want to carry the guilt of having destroyed it).

Throughout this book, we'll look back on these ideas: *Clarity*, *fluidity*, and *elegance*. They're the qualitative tests we'll use to decide if we've improved upon a name.
