## Final: What Makes a Name Good? 

So what does a good name *look* like? As with most things in programming, it depends.

* A good name might be long. 
* It might be short. 
* It might stand out. 
* It might fade into the background. 
* It might be full of detail. 
* It might be abstract. 

Like writing prose, the quality of any particular word depends on the context of all the other words around it. 

Now, what does a good name *feel* like? I can answer that more assuredly.

First, a good name makes code clearer. If a method's name requires you to dig into the details everytime you stumble across it, there's a likely chance you can come up with a better name.

Second, good names make reading code more fluid. You can scan code more easily because the words flow better together. Your eyes dance over the code because its shape feels natural. You  grasp what the code is saying because there's an orderliness to the way constructs are named.

Finally, good names make the exact same code more elegant. Code that's elegant is more enjoyable to work with. It's also likely to _stay_ elegant. The next coder will care more about a well-written codebase because they'll appreciate the work that's already there (or, at least, don't want to carry the guilt of having destroyed it).

Remember these values: *Clarity*, *fluidity*, and *elegance*. They're the qualitative tests we'll use to decide if we've improved upon a name.
