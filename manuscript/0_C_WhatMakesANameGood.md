# What makes a name good?

Coding is the strangest kind of art. 

The person who is reading your code isn't doing so relaxed in their favorite chair, curled up to their laptop under a warm light with a cup of hot chocolate in-hand. 

Your reader is probably sitting at their desk, hunched over a screen with a furrowed brow, intensely focused on determining what your code is doing because they're about to fix something or add something to it. Their coffee is getting cold.

Writing code is not like writing a novel or sculpting a piece of art or building a spaceship. All of these acts end with a final product that remains fixed. There is no sense of finality to code writing. It is constantly iterated upon even after the software finally launches. You write code knowing that it may eventually change again. There is no ending.

This makes naming things in code a special kind of skill. You aren't writing for the reader; You're writing for the next writer. That makes the goals of naming fundamentally unique.

Some names might describe and guide. Some names might be easy to scan. Some names might be memorable. Some names might simply get out of the way. It all depends on how the names of things, together, piece the entire story of your codebase. This book will show you a handful of different kinds of naming conundrums and describe why I landed upon a particular name. 

/* I dunno here....*/

In the end, if you choose good names, your codebase will be clearer. It will 

Good names will make reading your codebase more fluid. You can scan code more easily because the words flow better together. Your eyes dance over the code because its shape feels natural. You grasp what the code is saying because there's an orderliness to the way constructs are named.

Finally, good names--if it can do so without sacrificing more important matters--will delight your reader. Yes, delight your reader. If you can make a future reader of your code go, "Oh- I like the way you named that!", you should. In the same way that a great cook can make food taste delectable, not just nourish, or a great architect can design a building that inspires, not just protects, a great code writer can write code that delights, not just functions. The mildly stressed developer will thank you for it.

Remember these values: *Clarity*, *fluidity*, and *delight*. They're the qualitative tests we'll use to decide if we've improved upon a name.
