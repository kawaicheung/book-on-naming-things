# What makes a name good?

Coding is the strangest kind of art. For starters, our audience is ourselves, our fellow programmers alone. No one--in their right mind--is a casual reader of code. 

There is also no sense of finality. Code writing is never "done". It is constantly iterated upon even after (and especially when) the software finally launches. The person who is reading code isn't doing so relaxed on their favorite chair, curled up to their laptop under the warm light of a reading lamp with a cup of hot chocolate in-hand. 

Instead, the reader is probably sitting at their desk, mildly stressed with furrowed brow, in the process of figuring out what the code is trying to say because they're about to fix something about it or add something to it. Their coffee is getting cold.

A good name might...

* Stand out amongst other code so it's easy to spot at a glance.
* Make the code around it more readable.
* Make the intentions obvious.
* Be memorable. The next day, you can say exactly what the name of something is without looking back at the code.

The key word is that it _might_. Most times, you can't achieve all of these goals with one name. Sometimes, you have to decide what goals are more important in a particular situation, and drive the name toward achieving those goals first.

This makes the qualifications for a good name different than any other kind of name in any other kind of writing. 

* A good name might be long. It might be short.
* It might stand out. It might fade into the background. 
* It might be full of detail. It might be abstract. 

By naming things well, the entire codebase improves. Indeed, the whole codebase becomes much more readable than simply the sum of its parts. 

Good names will make your codebase clearer. If a method's name requires you to dig into the details everytime you stumble across it, it's likely you can come up with a better name.

Good names will make reading your codebase more fluid. You can scan code more easily because the words flow better together. Your eyes dance over the code because its shape feels natural. You grasp what the code is saying because there's an orderliness to the way constructs are named.

Finally, good names--if it can do so without sacrificing more important matters--will delight your reader. Yes, delight your reader. If you can make a future reader of your code go, "Oh- I like the way you named that!", you should. In the same way that a great cook can make food taste delectable, not just nourish, or a great architect can design a building that inspires, not just protects, a great code writer can write code that delights, not just functions. The mildly stressed developer will thank you for it.

Remember these values: *Clarity*, *fluidity*, and *delight*. They're the qualitative tests we'll use to decide if we've improved upon a name.
