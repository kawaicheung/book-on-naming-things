# Why naming matters

Our industry is littered with techniques on building sustainable software. But, these techniques usually come with caveats. They're typically large in scope. You can't just mix in a framework, pattern, or architecture like paint on a canvas -- it's intensive work. You might spend weeks on a refactoring and realize the result wasn't worth the effort.

This is why I'm such a fan of renaming things. Renaming an object or method isn't labor intensive but in can clarify something previously ambiguous. It might expose an obvious refactoring you didn't see before. It also  makes it easier for someone else to figure out what your intentions were when you wrote the code. That "someone else" might even be you a few months from now.

If clarity is the end goal, then naming things well is its primary path; essential no matter where you are in the stack, what language you use, or how nicely you think the code is otherwise written. If you name things well, you write clearer code.
